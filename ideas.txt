Naming
- TranscRhythm (get it? transcription + rhythm = transcrhythm)
- Transcrithm

Optimizations:
- Make methods inline
- Lower amount of allocations (ex: variable inside a loop to outside, or vice-versa)
- Try to use stack allocated arrays instead of vectors
    - Accessing heap is slow!!! We can implement some SSO-like functionality to cover edge cases
- Create caches to avoid possible duplicated computations

- Try to gather data about the notes that we can use to help assist in getting BPM
    - Diddles..?

- Add tests!!!!

- BD 2017 has a few challenges:
    - Split quintuplet, ie beat lies between two sixteenth note quintuplets
    - 4 notes over 
- The 3 beat multibeat would need a division of 120 over the entire thing 


- Architecture:
    - namespace Transcrithm
        - AudioTranscriber: Transcribes audio data into notes with timestamps/durations. Gets additional data such as articulation/dynamic
            - NoteTranscriber
            - ArticulationTranscriber
        - RhythmTranscriber
            - BPMAnalyzer
            - BeatAnalyzer
            - NoteAnalyzer (or RhythmAnalyzer)
        - Transcription: Holds data for a transcription, output of RhythmTranscriber
            - Read/write from file
        - Generic transcription config
        - Generic transcribe function that combines AudioTranscriber and RhythmTranscriber

Math:
- Exp decay functions
    - f(x) = e^(-(x/s)^p)
        - Value for `s` to pass through (x0, y0): s = x0/pow(-ln(y0), 1/p)
    - f(x) = s/((x-c)^p+s)
        - `c` is the x coordinate to put the top of the curve, this is usually just 0
        - Value for `s` to pass through (x0, y0): s = (y0*(x0-c)^p)/(1-y0)
        - To allow for negative numbers with various values for `p`, put absolute value around `x`.
        - Advantage: Doesn't need to use `pow`, can expand in code if exponent is integer, likely just 2

"even a trained musician will hit a drum beat slightly ahead or behind the metronome (with a SD of typically 5â€“15 ms)"

https://phys.org/news/2012-07-errors-rhythm-pattern-physicists.html
"Though the drummer is a professional, like all humans, his rhythm is imperfect. Each time his hand hits the drum, his beat 
falls ahead or behind the metronome by 10 to 20 milliseconds. On average, he anticipates the beat, and plays ahead of it, 16 
milliseconds ahead"

Terminology:
- IBI (inter-beat-interval): Time between beats
- IOI (inter-onset-interval): Time between notes
