Optimizations:
- Make methods inline
- Lower amount of allocations (ex: variable inside a loop to outside, or vice-versa)

- Try to gather data about the notes that we can use to help assist in getting BPM
    - Diddles..?
- Get BPM
    - Try how often notes change from slow->fast or fast->slow
        - Don't look at note strings, simply just compare each note to the very next note and if it's close to a multiple,
          consider it a change.
        - The duration of most changes should be close to a factor of the IBI (duration of beat)
        - The longer the duration of the division is, the less accurate it becomes.
            - Any time a duration of the division lasts longer than a beat at the correct BPM, the total duration of the 
              division is less likely to be accurate due to more room for error from the human performer.
- Now, instead of first trying to get note strings, do the "guess where the beat starts" thing with the BPM
- Use these possible beat starts to help get note strings/rhythms


- When deciding note rhythm, instead of raw dist with BPM/rhythm complexity, also take into account what it does to the beat.
    - For instance, Rhyhtm X 2022 break has weird situation where last note in a beat is at 3/4 of the beat, with a division
      of 12/11. Adding 11/12 to 0.75 gives us a nice 1.667, so even though that division seems impossible, it lines up well.
- The whole notion of deciding rhythm by dist with BPM/rhythm complexity (notes * beats) is naive. Lots of little note chunks
  end with a note that ends up having a weird division because the next note is in a different beat with a different division.


Division changes:
- Need algorithm for determining which notes are most likely the same division
- We already have the ability to measure how well notes compare to each other in terms of raw duration, as well as how note
  strings compare to other note strings, note strings compare to individual notes, etc.
- We need to be able to test hypothetical strings easily,

"even a trained musician will hit a drum beat slightly ahead or behind the metronome (with a SD of typically 5â€“15 ms)"

"Though the drummer is a professional, like all humans, his rhythm is imperfect. Each time his hand hits the drum, his beat 
falls ahead or behind the metronome by 10 to 20 milliseconds. On average, he anticipates the beat, and plays ahead of it, 16 
milliseconds ahead"
